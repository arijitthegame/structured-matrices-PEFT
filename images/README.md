The folder contains experiments on a synthetic pinwheel data. 

- pinwheel.png is the pictorial representation of the data.
- frozen_emb.png shows training curves of various methods when the bottom layer is frozen.
- unfrozen_emb.png shows training curves of various methods when the entire model is trained. 
- query_cosine_sim.jpg shows the similarity between the newly trained weights and the pretrained weights of the query matrix for various layer of BERT on MRPC.
- value_cosine_sim.jpg shows the similarity between the newly trained weights and the pretrained weights of the value matrix for various layer of BERT on MRPC.
